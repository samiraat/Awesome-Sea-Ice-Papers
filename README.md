## Introduction
Sea ice type classification is a crucial task for understanding and predicting Arctic and Antarctic ice conditions. This repository aggregates key papers that explore various machine learning techniques, including semi-supervised and supervised learning approaches, to classify sea ice types effectively. The focus is on methodologies that target both patch-level classification and pixel-level semantic segmentation.
